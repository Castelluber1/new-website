							<h3>What it is</h3>
							<p>
								A permanent residence program that lets Canadian citizens and
								permanent residents sponsor their spouse or partner (married,
								common-law, or conjugal) to live together in Canada.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="wp-card">
							<h3>How it works</h3>
							<p>
								Your application tells your story proving your relationship is
								genuine. We help you prepare the right documents, organize your
								evidence, and respond confidently. In many cases, you can even
								get an open work permit while your PR is being processed.
							</p>

							<h3>Missing Documents</h3>

								Important forms or certificates are forgotten or expire before

							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wp-card">
							<h3>Weak relationship proof</h3>
							<p>
								Evidence sent without context or sequence, leaving gaps in the

							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wp-card">
							<h3>Inconsistecies</h3>
							<p>
								Dates, names, or addresses differ across forms, passports, or
								letters. Even small inconsistencies can create credibility
								issues.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="wp-card">
							<h3>Late responses to IRCC requests</h3>
							<p>
								Applicants sometimes miss deadlines for extra documents,
								biometrics, or medical exams. These delays can freeze or close
								the application entirely.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wp-card">
							<h3>Poor translations</h3>
							<p>
								Documents not in English or French arrive without proper
								certified translations, or photos don’t meet size/background
								rules—leading to re-submissions.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wp-card">
							<h3>Not reporting updates</h3>
							<p>
								Moves, new passports, or changes to employment or status aren’t
								reported, leaving IRCC with outdated information during
								processing.

			<!-- FAQ -->
			<section class="faq">
				<div class="container pb50">
					<h2 class="subpage pb50">Frequently asked questions</h2>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>What’s the difference between inland and outland?</h3>
						<p>
							Inland is filed while living together in Canada; outland is
							processed through a visa office abroad. We pick the stream that
							fits your travel, work, and timeline needs.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Can the sponsored spouse work while PR is in process?</h3>
						<p>
							Some inland applicants can apply for an open work permit;
							eligibility depends on current rules. We confirm if this applies
							to you.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>What relationship proof is required?</h3>
						<p>
							Marriage or common-law documentation, shared leases or bank
							accounts, photos anything that demonstrate a genuine relationship.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>How long does spousal sponsorship take?</h3>
						<p>
							Timelines vary by stream and visa office. We set expectations and
							structure your file to reduce avoidable delays.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Will we be interviewed?</h3>
						<p>
							Interviews are not automatic. Strong, consistent evidence can
							reduce interview likelihood; we prepare you if one is requested.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Can we include dependent children?</h3>
						<p>
							Yes, if they meet the definition of dependent; we include forms,
							custody documents, and medicals as required.
