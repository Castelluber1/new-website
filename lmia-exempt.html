							<h3>How LMIA-exempt works</h3>
							<p>
								Canada can approve certain work permits without the Labour
								Market Impact Assessment when there’s a recognized public,
								cultural, or economic benefit. It’s called the
								<strong>International Mobility Program (IMP)</strong> the same
								program used by universities, ministries, and global companies.
							</p>
						</article>

						<article class="wp-card">
							<h3>Who typically qualifies</h3>
							<p>
								People in <strong>specific professional contexts</strong> often
								fit: professors and researchers invited by Canadian
								institutions, pastors and ministry leaders joining religious
								communities, artists, athletes, executives transferred within a
								global group, and professionals with
								<strong>French as their main working language</strong> outside
								Quebec.
							</p>
						</article>

						<article class="wp-card">
							<h3>What happens if you qualify</h3>
							<p>
								The process skips the LMIA, meaning your employer doesn’t need
								job advertising or recruitment proof. You can usually apply
								directly for a <strong>work permit</strong>, pay lower fees, and
								move forward faster with a clearer approval path.
