				<div class="container pb50">
					<h2 class="subpage pb50">Frequently asked questions</h2>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Do I need a job offer to qualify?</h3>
						<p>

							qualify and receive ITAs without one.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Which language tests are accepted?</h3>
						<p>
							Common options include IELTS or CELPIP for English and TEF/TCF for
							French. Scores must be valid when you submit e-APR.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Do I need an ECA?</h3>
						<p>
							Education obtained outside Canada generally needs an Educational
							Credential Assessment to count for CRS points.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>How can I increase my CRS?</h3>
						<p>
							Language re-takes, ECA updates, additional education, spouse
							points, provincial nomination, or a valid job offer can boost
							scores.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>What is proof of funds?</h3>
						<p>
							Financial savings that meet the minimum required for your family
							size (unless exempt). Funds must be available and unencumbered.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>How long does Express Entry take?</h3>
						<p>
							Timelines vary by stream, draw patterns, and file completeness. We
							set expectations and structure your file to reduce avoidable
							delays.
