							<h3>Choosing a province</h3>
							<p>
								Most provinces and territories run their own nomination streams.
								You don’t pick a province they select candidates who match their
								priorities.<br /><br />
								We analyze your background to see where your profile aligns with
								current provincial needs and where a nomination is realistically
								possible.
							</p>
						</article>

						<!-- Card 2 -->
						<article class="wp-card">
							<h3>Getting a nomination</h3>
							<p>
								A provincial nomination adds CRS points and strongly increases
								your chance of an invitation. It is not permanent residence by
								itself, but it can change your score and timing in a meaningful
								way.<br /><br />
								We estimate the impact for your profile using recent draw
								patterns so you know what to expect.
							</p>
						</article>

						<!-- Card 3 -->
						<article class="wp-card">
							<h3>Next Steps</h3>
							<p>
								Once we see where your profile aligns, we set a practical plan
								with clear steps. That includes the right evidence, clean job
								and study history, and timing that fits how provinces are
								selecting now.<br /><br />
								We help you build a plan to be nomination-ready without wasting
								time or effort on uncertain options.

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Which province is best</h3>
						<p>
							The best province is the one that values your specific profile

						<h3>How long does PNP take</h3>
