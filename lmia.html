					<h2 class="subpage pb50">Frequently asked questions</h2>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Do I always need an LMIA for a work permit?</h3>
						<p>
							No. Some work permits are
							<a class="wp-link" href="/lmia-exempt">LMIA-exempt</a> under
							international agreements or special programs. When an LMIA is
							required, the employer must obtain it before the worker can apply
							for a work permit.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Who is responsible for paying LMIA fees?</h3>
						<p>
							The employer pays the government processing fee and covers
							recruitment costs. It is illegal for employers to recover
							LMIA-related expenses from workers directly or indirectly.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>How long does the LMIA process take?</h3>
						<p>
							Average timelines range from 8 to 12 weeks, depending on the
							stream and workload at Service Canada. Global Talent Stream
							applications are typically processed within two weeks if all
							documents are complete.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>
							What is the difference between High-Wage and Low-Wage streams?
						</h3>
						<p>
							High-Wage jobs pay at or above the regional median wage and need a
							transition plan. Low-Wage jobs pay below the median and may
							include limits or extra employer conditions.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>What is the Global Talent Stream?</h3>
						<p>
							A fast-track LMIA option for employers hiring highly skilled
							talent in tech and specialized occupations. It requires a Labour
							Market Benefits Plan outlining how the hire will contribute to
							innovation and skill development in Canada.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Can a worker apply for an LMIA directly?</h3>
						<p>
							No. Only employers can apply for an LMIA. Once approved, the
							foreign worker uses the LMIA confirmation letter to apply for a
							closed work permit.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Why do some LMIA applications get refused?</h3>
						<p>
							Common reasons include missing recruitment proof, wages below the
							regional standard, unclear job duties, inconsistencies in
							documents, or a weak business justification for hiring a foreign
							worker. We can help you avoid these pitfalls

								class="wp-link"
								href="https://upmmigrationconsultation.as.me/Employers"
								>book a meeting.</a
							>
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>How long is a positive LMIA valid?</h3>
						<p>
							A positive LMIA is usually valid for six months. The worker must
							apply for the work permit before it expires. The worker may get an
							closed work permit valid for up to three years, depending on the
							job offer.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>Are employers required to advertise the position?</h3>
						<p>
							In most streams, yes. Employers must post the job on at least
							three recruitment platforms for a minimum of four weeks and
							provide detailed evidence of their efforts when submitting the
							LMIA.
